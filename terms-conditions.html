                            notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of
                            the State of Texas and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts
                            in Texas in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site
                            is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these

                            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists

                            of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in
                            this agreement is in derogation of Patco's right to comply with governmental, court and law
                            enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information
                            provided to or gathered by Patco with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is

                            limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
                            invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable
                            provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder
                            of the agreement shall continue in effect.<br><br>

                            Patco with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given
                            in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon
                            or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
                            business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is
                            the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in
